description: Welcome to Galaxy UI - A modern component library for Angular
---

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Welcome to **Galaxy UI** - a modern, framework-agnostic UI component library that combines the elegant design of Nebular with the flexibility of shadcn/ui's copy-paste philosophy.

## What is Galaxy UI?

Galaxy UI is **not** a traditional component library. Instead of installing components as npm dependencies, you copy the source code directly into your project. This gives you complete control to customize, modify, and adapt components to your specific needs.

## Why Galaxy UI?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Full Control" icon="setting">
    Components are copied into your codebase. Modify them however you want without worrying about breaking changes or version conflicts.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Tailwind Native" icon="pencil">
    Built entirely with Tailwind CSS. No CSS-in-JS, no proprietary styling system. Just clean, utility-first CSS.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Beautiful Design" icon="star">
    Inspired by Nebular's elegant and professional aesthetic. Components look great out of the box with thoughtful attention to detail.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Type Safe" icon="approve-check">
    Written in TypeScript with full type definitions. Catch errors at compile time and get excellent IDE support.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Accessible" icon="information">
    Built with accessibility in mind. Proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Dark Mode" icon="moon">
    First-class dark mode support using Tailwind's dark mode utilities. No extra configuration needed.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Philosophy

### Copy, Don't Install

Unlike traditional component libraries, Galaxy UI components are meant to be copied into your project:

```bash
# Instead of npm install
npx galaxy-ui-cli@latest add button

# This copies button.component.ts directly into your project
```

This approach gives you:

- **Ownership**: The code is yours to modify
- **Transparency**: See exactly what's happening
- **Flexibility**: Customize without constraints
- **No version hell**: No breaking changes from updates

### Tailwind First

All components use Tailwind CSS utility classes:

```typescript
// Clean, readable, customizable
class="px-4 py-2 rounded-md bg-violet-600 text-white hover:bg-violet-700"
```

No mysterious CSS files, no build-time injection, just Tailwind utilities.

### Framework Agnostic (Coming Soon)

While we're starting with Angular, Galaxy UI is designed to support multiple frameworks:

- âœ… **Angular** - Available now
- ðŸš§ **React** - Coming soon
- ðŸš§ **Vue** - Coming soon

The same design system, the same philosophy, across all frameworks.

## Comparison

### Galaxy UI vs Traditional Libraries

| Feature | Galaxy UI | Traditional Library |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Installation** | Copy source code | npm install |
| **Updates** | Manual (your choice) | Automatic (potential breaking) |
| **Customization** | Full access to source | Limited by props/API |
| **Bundle Size** | Only what you use | Entire library |
| **Learning Curve** | Understand the code | Learn the API |
| **Lock-in** | None | Vendor lock-in |

### Galaxy UI vs shadcn/ui

Galaxy UI is heavily inspired by shadcn/ui but focused on Angular:

- **Same philosophy**: Copy-paste components
- **Same approach**: Tailwind CSS
- **Different framework**: Angular (vs React)
- **Different design**: Nebular-inspired (vs Radix UI)

## Component Status Colors

Galaxy UI uses a consistent status color system across all components:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Basic">
    <div class="h-8 bg-slate-600 rounded"></div>
    Default, neutral actions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Primary">
    <div class="h-8 bg-violet-600 rounded"></div>
    Main call-to-action
  </Card>
  <Card title="Success">
    <div class="h-8 bg-emerald-600 rounded"></div>
    Positive outcomes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Info">
    <div class="h-8 bg-cyan-600 rounded"></div>
    Informational messages
  </Card>
  <Card title="Warning">
    <div class="h-8 bg-amber-500 rounded"></div>
    Caution required
  </Card>
  <Card title="Danger">
    <div class="h-8 bg-red-600 rounded"></div>
    Destructive actions
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Size Variants

Components offer consistent sizing:

- **Tiny**: Compact, for dense interfaces
- **Small**: Slightly smaller than default
- **Medium**: Default, balanced size
- **Large**: Prominent, easy to tap
- **Giant**: Maximum impact
