## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize your project
npx galaxy-ui-cli@latest init

# Add your first component
npx galaxy-ui-cli@latest add button
```

## Philosophy

Galaxy UI follows the **copy-paste component** approach:

- **No npm install**: Components aren't dependencies
- **Full ownership**: Modify components however you need
- **Tailwind native**: Uses utility classes, not CSS-in-JS
- **Type-safe**: Written in TypeScript with full type definitions
